        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Georgia Winship and I've been a Software Developer working on both frontend and backend projects for 2 years now, 
            I also hold both a Bachelors and Masters degree in Computer Science for Games Development. 
            I like to think I'm definitely the tech and software whiz in my family as I have been passionate about technology and software ever since I was a child. 
            When it comes to my work, I pride myself on making sure that any code I develop is clean, functional and performs well whilst also taking the end user 
            into account and ensuring that their needs and requirements are met. When I'm not developing software, I love to play video games that are immersive 
            and story driven, watch anime that's action packed and has a emotional story as well as watch grown, muscly men and women beat each other up in a wrestling ring. </p>
